# Image-classification
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance hich is learnable weights and biases to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
I have used CNN algorithm to classify the images. In this project I have used one folder for the my own images and one folder for the other friend pictures and the webite is able to get correct ~ 87% predicton uing activation function uch a 'relu', and 'sigmoid'.
